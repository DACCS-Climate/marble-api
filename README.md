### Coding Style

This codebase uses the [`ruff`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) formatter and linter to enforce style policies.

To check that your changes conform to these policies please run:

```sh
ruff format
ruff check
```

You can also set up pre-commit hooks that will run these checks before you create any commit in this repo:

```sh
pre-commit install
```

### Versioning

Marble API is a versioned REST API. Backwards compatible changes can be made to existing versions.
If you wish to introduce backwards incompatible changes, you must create a new version.

To create a new version:

- create a new directory under `app/versions` with the name of the next version (eg: v2, v3, etc.)
- create a new `FastAPI` app in that directory and add any routes, models, etc. 
- in `app/main.py` import the app from the new version and append it to the `VERSIONS` constant.
- the `VERSIONS` constant contains tuples where the first value is the version prefix (eg: `/v2`, `/v3`, etc.)
  and the second value contains the corresponding app.

Note that all applications in the `VERSIONS` constant will implement any routes defined in previous versions
(ie. versions that are listed earlier in `VERSIONS`). 

If a route should not be made available in later versions, add the `@last_version` decorator to it.

For example, if v1 defines:

```python
@app.get("/test")
def test():
    ...
```

Then the `/test` route will be available in versions `/v2`, `/v3`, etc.

If v2 then redefines it as:

```python
@app.get("/test")
@last_version
def test():
    ...
```

Then the `/test` route will not be available from `/v3` onwards.

## Testing

To run tests:

```sh
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.test.txt
pytest test/
```
